# Seismic-Hazard-Prediction with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree
Welcome to the Seismic Hazard Prediction project! This repository contains the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree models to classify and predict seismic hazard risks from real-world data. The performance of both models are compared, evaluated and analysed.

## Introduction
Seismic hazard prediction is a critical task in mitigating the impact of earthquakes and improving disaster preparedness. In this project, we apply supervised machine learning techniques to classify seismic activity as hazardous (0) or non-hazardous (1). The models are trained and evaluated using key performance metrics with a focus on recall for hazard detection (Class 1) to reduce false negatives and ensure high sensitivity. 

Our work involves preprocessing data, handling class imbalance, applying feature selection, and tuning model hyperparameters. The project compares models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree to determine the most effective method for seismic risk prediction.
